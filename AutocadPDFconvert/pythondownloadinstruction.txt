To “download” (create) venv311 first and then activate it with your Activate.ps1, use these steps in PowerShell on Windows.
​

1. Create the Python 3.11 virtualenv
From PowerShell:

powershell
# Go to the folder where you want the venv folder to live
cd "C:/Users/MokZhiZhuan/OneDrive - WINSYS TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD/Documents/AutocadPDFconvert"

# Create virtual environment named venv311 using your default Python 3.11
python -m venv venv311
This will create C:/Users/MokZhiZhuan/OneDrive - WINSYS TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD/Documents/AutocadPDFconvert/venv311 with the Scripts/Activate.ps1 file inside.
​

If you have multiple Python versions and want to force 3.11 explicitly, point to its python.exe:

powershell
"C:/Path/To/Python311/python.exe" -m venv venv311
2. Allow running the activation script (once per user)
If you have not enabled script execution yet:

powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
3. Activate venv311 with Activate.ps1
Now activate the newly created venv:

powershell
& "C:/Users/MokZhiZhuan/OneDrive - WINSYS TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD/Documents/AutocadPDFconvert/venv311/Scripts/Activate.ps1"
Your PowerShell prompt should now show something like (venv311) at the start, meaning the virtual environment is active and all python / pip commands are using Python 3.11 inside this venv.
​
After that run pip install -r requirements.txt
